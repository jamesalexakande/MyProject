This is a sample change made on the About Me Branch
About Me: 
My name is James Akande and I am a budding technical writer with content marketing experience.
Specifically experience creating and optimizxing content across personal dev, web apps, and Blockchain 
However, I have had a heavy leaning on Blockchain, so that makes me a Blockchain Technical Writer,
SINCE MY SPECIALTY WAS IN CREATING EXPLAINERS TO DEMYSTIFY TECHNICAL CONTENT.
Pursuing a career in Technical Writing sits at an intersection of my love for technology, systems, and my general fascination with the dev world
And of course, my passion for learning new techologies, while writing about them.
My aim is to create a better world for developers and end-users via documentation that simplifies.
Thank you. 
About me end.
